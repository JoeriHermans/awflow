Pythonic reusable acyclic workflows. Execute code on HPC systems as if you executed them on your laptop!

### Motivation

Tired of writing and managing Slurm submission scripts?

**Under development!**

### Roadmap

- [ ] Developer requirements
- [ ] Documentation
- [ ] Enforce acyclicity of compute graph
- [ ] Logging directory
- [ ] Pruning of compute graph based on postconditions (prevent re-execution)
- [ ] README
- [ ] Utility scripts to manage workflows running on Slurm.
- [ ] `@aw.disable` decorator
